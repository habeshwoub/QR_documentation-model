            <div>

                <div>
                    <h7>A) Lightweight artifacts to document QRs:</h7>
                    <p>Teams can adopt lightweight artifacts that are compatible with the short iteration cycles of ASD.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        </br>

                        <ol>1. Teams can adopt ‘given-when-then’ templates to specify QRs as acceptance criteria (e.g., acceptance criteria of a reliability QR in a mobile travel app can be specified as, Given
                            <the app is launched and in the homepage> When
                                < the user clicks ‘My trips’ button> then
                                    < the available trips page should load under 3 seconds>.
                        </ol>
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        <ol> 2. ASD teams can also document QRs by including them as acceptance criteria for user stories. For instance, a security QR for checking the SSL certificate of the log-in webpage of an e-commerce site can be written as acceptance
                            criteria of a user story as follows: </ol>
                        </br>
                        <p>
                            As a
                            <user>, I want to
                                <log in to the webpage safely>, So that
                                    <I can make online purchases>
                                        Acceptance criteria: Perform SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) test for the page
                                        (Behutiye et al., 2020c).
                        </p>

                    </ul>

                </div>
            </br>
                <div>
                    <h7>B) Teams tailor their practices to achieve optimal QR documentation in their process:</h7>
                    </br>
                    <ul>

                    </br>
                        <ol> 1. Scrum teams may adopt theme-oriented sprints (e.g. a sprint for implementation and
                            a sprint for documentation). In a documentation sprint, the teams handle
                            documentation tasks and make improvements regarding QRs.</ol>

                        </br> </br>
                        <ol> 2. Alternatively, teams may allocate separate organizations that are responsible for
                            documenting and managing QRs. This is more relevant in the embedded systems and
                            telecommunications domain, as well as in product domains that are required to meet
                            specific regulations and standard certifications. For instance, companies adopt
                            separate organizations and dedicated teams responsible for handling the security and
                            performance QRs of their products. These organizations produce and manage related
                            QR documentation (Alnatheer et al., 2014; Behutiye et al., 2020c, 2020a). </ol>

<h7>C) Allocate sufficient resources and assign responsibilities: </h7> </br>
<p>Allocate sufficient resources and assign clear responsibilities: assigning sufficient resources
    and clear responsibility to document and handle QRs can help mitigate issues that may occur
    16
    due to time constraints. Moreover, when the ASD team works collaboratively, there are
    adequate resources and clear responsibilities regarding QRs. Everyone works to achieve a
    common goal, and thus, ASD teams can minimize documentation issues that may occur due
    to time constraints</p>
