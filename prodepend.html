            <h2 class="h1md"> How does the project characteristic influence the effect of time constraints, limited awareness about quality requirements (QRs), and communication gap among team members, on QR documentation in ASD. </h2>

                <p style="text-align:justify">

                    Whether time constraints affectQR documentation in ASD depend on project characteristics (e.g., sprint duration used in the development process and resource availability for QR documentation). </br>
                    For instance, in a project with a two-week sprint duration, ASD teams may find it difficult to complete an adequate amount of QR documentation. </br> However, on projects with a longer sprint duration (e.g., longer than two weeks),
                    the effect of time constraints on documenting QRs is minimal since the long sprint duration offers enough time for documentation. </br>Additionally, projects with insufficient resources for documenting and managing QRs underspecify
                    and fail to document QRs when there is a time constraint. </br>Projects that have sufficient resource allocation and clear goals regarding QRs and their documentation may not face similar problems.

                <p style="text-align:justify">

                    Whether QR awareness affects documentation depends on project characteristics. </br> For instance, some projects can establish process for documenting and managing QRs. </br> In these projects, the likelihood that issues arise from
                    limited QR awareness is minimal since there is an established process for documenting and managing QRs. </br> However, if projects do not have a process for documenting and managing QRs, limited knowledge of QRs among the ASD stakeholders
                    can create challenges in documenting QRs. </br> Additionally, in projects where hardware is involved (e.g., in the embedded domain), identifying and specifying QRs early on is difficult. This is because QRs evolve and may require hardware
                    changes

                <h3 style="text-align: left;"> Project dependecy when considering communication gap among team members </h3>
                <br/>
                <p style="text-align:justify">

                    Whether a communication gap among team members affects QR documentation depends on project characteristics such as practices for QR documentation and management. </br> For instance, projects that specify and document QRs clearly and
                    early in the development process and have established practices to resolve communication gaps (e.g., openly discussing unclear QRs and resolving QR issues) are less likely to be affected than projects that do not practice early specification
                    or openly discuss QR issues. </br>
                    In the case of large-scale distributed ASD setting, if QRs are not clearly specified and communicated among team members, managing them becomes challenging.
