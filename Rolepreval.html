                    Whether time constraints affect QR documentation are not more prevalent in some roles than in others. Instead, the effect of time constraints is more dependent on how the whole ASD team functions. The likelihood that time constraints affect QR documentation
                    is minimal in collaborative ASD teams with sufficient resources and clear responsibilities regarding QRs. However, when the responsibilities for documenting and managing QRs are unclear or ambiguities exist in the QRs, time constraints
                    tend to affect QR documentation (e.g., QRs are neglected and are not specified or documented) (Cajander et al., 2013).

                <h3 style="text-align: left;">Prevalence of roles when considering the limited awareness about quality requirements (QRs)
                </h3>
                <br/>
                <p style="text-align:justify">

                    Limited QR awareness affecting QR documentation is more prevalent in some roles, such as junior developers, since they may lack knowledge of QRs. Additionally, it is highly important that project managers and product owners are well oriented and have
                    adequate knowledge of QRs since they specify the requirements and decide on the quality readiness of products. Customersâ€™ knowledge of QRs also affects the documentation and implementation of QRs. Customers who do not understand the
                    significance of QRs may not allocate enough funding in the budget to implement and manage QRs (Camacho et al., 2016). On projects with established processes for documenting and managing QRs, knowledge of QRs in some roles, such as
                    developers, may not be as important since there are clear responsibilities and procedures for documenting and managing QRs. However, when there are no established processes, it is important that developers have good knowledge of QRs.

                <h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prevalence of roles when considering communication gap among team members </h3>
                <br/>
                <p style="text-align:justify">

                    How communication gaps among team members affect QR documentation is dependent on how the whole ASD team functions. ASD teams with established practices and clearly allocated roles for documenting and managing QRs are less likely to face QR documentation
                    issues due to communication gaps among team members.
