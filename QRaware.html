                <div>
                    <h7>A) Raise QR awareness among members of the ASD team:</h7>

                    <ul>
                        </br>

                        <ol>1. Invest in QR training </ol>
                        </br>

                        <p>ASD teams should work on developing their knowledge of documenting and managing QRs. Management should invest in training regarding QRs to familiarize ASD team members with relevant QRs and practices to document and handle them.
                            It is highly important to ensure that some roles, such as project managers and product owners, have good knowledge of QRs. Training on QRs is particularly beneficial to junior developers who may not be familiar with QRs and
                            practices for documenting and managing them in the company.
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        <ol> 2. Utilize a QR checklist </ol>
                        </br>
                        <p>
                            ASD teams can adopt a checklist for relevant QRs, including how to specify, document, and manage them within the company. Such a checklist will help developers and other ASD team members become acquainted with QRs and the recommended practices involved
                            in documenting and managing them. Moreover, since some practitioners (e.g., product owners) are prone to forgetting QRs (Behutiye et al., 2020a; Nawrocki et al., 2014), a QR checklist is valuable.
                        </p>

                    </ul>

                </div>
                </br>
                <div>
                    <h7>B) Guiding customers on QRs:</h7>
                    </br>
                    </br>

                    <p> Limited QR awareness among customers affects QR documentation (Behutiye et al., 2020a, 2020b; Sillitti and Succi, 2005). For instance, customers may not be aware of all the relevant QRs needed for their product in the early phases.
                        In such cases, practitioners (e.g., product owners and business analysts) should help and guide customers in identifying and specifying QRs.</p>
